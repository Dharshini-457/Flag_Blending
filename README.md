# 🌀 Mapping a Pattern onto a Waving Flag  🏳



##  🏳 This project shows how to realistically blend a flat pattern onto a waving flag using Python and OpenCV. The steps mimic how fabric catches light and folds, producing a natural-looking .

# 🛠️ How It Works 🏳


## 📌Load the Images Pattern.jpg and Flag.jpg are loaded into memory using OpenCV. 🏳

## 📌Resize and Warp the Pattern The pattern is resized to match the flag's dimensions. Then, mesh deformation is used so it flows along the flag’s curves.🏳

## 📌Isolate the Flag Cloth A brightness-based threshold creates a binary mask to isolate the flag’s white cloth from its background.🏳

## 📌Simulate Fabric Folds The flag image is converted to grayscale, and its luminance is used to apply shading to the warped pattern. This step helps mimic how real light would fall on fabric folds.🏳

## 📌Blend the Pattern Using soft alpha blending, the shaded pattern is overlaid onto the flag. The mask ensures blending occurs only over the cloth area.🏳

## 📌Save the Output The final image, Output.jpg, shows the pattern realistically printed onto the waving flag—just l.🏳
